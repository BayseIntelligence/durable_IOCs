This repository is intended to capture indicators of compromise associated with attacks that can be used to identify
attacks over the course of *weeks, months, and years* instead of minutes, hours, and (maybe) days.

The original reason for creating the repository is to provide a way for us to share our Observables functionality
(more info [here](https://www.bayse.io/blog/observables-intro)) with the world in an easy way.
However, there may also be other long-lived indicators (such as credential collection domains and other infrastructure 
sites) that appear within this repository.

If you want to search for any of the indicators within this repository, head over to https://bayse.io/search!
